#Â MIDI I/O

In PureData there are objects to handle interfacing with a machines MIDI device.

**heavy** doesn't provide cross-platform implementation for MIDI I/O as the requirements tend to change depending on the platform or framework being used. 

Instead, it provides wrappers around these objects that route the data to specific hard-coded receivers/parameters in the patch context. For example a `[notein]` object will be replaced by a `[r __hv_notein]` receiver with input data split into its constituent parts and routed to the appropriate outlet.

`[notein]` wrapper implementation:

## Inputs

The following Pd objects are mapped to their corresponding heavy parameter.

| Pd object | heavy param    |
| --------- | -------------- |
| [notein]  | __hv_notein    |
| [ctlin]   | __hv_ctlin     |
| [pgmin]   | __hv_pgmin     |
| [bendin]  | __hv_bendin    |
| [touchin] | __hv_touchin   |


## Outputs

The same principle applies for sending MIDI data out of the heavy context. If you add a [noteout] object there'll be a corresponding sendhook callback with a message containing the MIDI data sent by the patch.

| Pd object  | heavy sendhook |
| ---------  | -------------- |
| [noteout]  | __hv_noteout   |
| [ctlout]   | __hv_ctlout    |
| [pgmout]   | __hv_pgmout    |
| [bendout]  | __hv_bendout   |
| [touchout] | __hv_touchout  |

## Note!

`It is generally the users responsibility to convert to and from the MIDI byte data to the float values used by heavy.`

Some framework targets like `dpf` already have implementations available. However, if you're integrating the C/C++ code on a custom platform then you'll need to provide your own conversion process.

Here's the `dpf` implementation as an example:
